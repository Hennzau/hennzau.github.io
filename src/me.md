### 👨‍💻 Who am I ?

My name is Enzo, I'm a postbac student 🏫 in my second year in CentraleSupélec Engineering School of France, specializing in physics and engineering science ! 👨‍🔬 I also have a great passion for programming so here is my GitHub 😄

###  A little more about me...

**🐱 What about development?**

> 👨‍💻 I was able to realize many projects, small things in video games, management applications or animations and robotic applications.
 >
> 🏆 I'm currently thinking about robotic applications for autonomous tasks.

> 📜 Since I'm studying a lot, I use the [reMarkable Tablet](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) to get organize. However I've not found a tool that can be used to save all your notebooks in PDF while recreating folder's tree structure. So I made a little tool to do this. It's really dirty and it works only for me **but** in the future I'll improve it and post it here. Message me if you want to hear about that.

> 🚫 For two years I studied mathematics and physics at Sainte-Geneviève prep-school in Versailles (France) so I had less time to spend on programming. Now I'm in Engineering School, I have more time.

**I'm now a Zed user**: one of the most awesome code editor, try it!!

**I was a Jetbrain user 🦉**
