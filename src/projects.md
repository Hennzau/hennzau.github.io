# üåü What Projects Do I Love to Work On?

I enjoy working on various types of projects, but there's always a common theme: **architectures and paradigms**. I'm really passionate about experimenting with new frameworks that offer different programming paradigms or architectures. üé®üíª

For example, I love working with **Bevy**, a game engine in Rust, which offers a fascinating programming paradigm (ECS - Entity Component System). Another favorite is **Dora**, a robotics framework in Rust, which has a very interesting **dataflow-oriented architecture**.

In addition to that, I also enjoy creating small tools that simplify everyday life for developers, such as setting up Python environments and managing installations more easily. üõ†Ô∏èüöÄ

# üöÄ Projects I Have Worked On

I started programming in **2014** with Java and later moved on to **C++ from 2017 to 2021**. Since **2021**, I‚Äôve been focusing all my time on **Rust**, which is a programming language I absolutely love! ‚ù§Ô∏è Along the way, I also picked up **Python**, which is particularly useful for academic projects.

Here‚Äôs a (non-exhaustive) inventory of some of the projects I've worked on (sorry, most of them aren't on GitHub üòÖ):

## üíª Java Projects

- **Game of Life**: This was one of my very first projects, where I implemented the Game of Life using Java, with **Swing** for the graphical interface.
- **J.A.R.V.I.S**: A voice assistant written in Java that used the Google Speech API for voice recognition. My Java skills were still quite limited at the time, so I built it using a rather clunky finite-state machine.
- **Voxel3D**: One of my first group projects. We aimed to recreate a Minecraft-like game in Java with **LWJGL2**. Although the project was fascinating, we had to abandon it due to the complexity of maintaining such a large project.

## üñ•Ô∏è C++ Projects

- **Voxel3D (C++ Edition)**: The same project as before but re-implemented in **C++**. I worked on this one solo and quickly saw the performance difference between Java and C++. Back then, I didn‚Äôt code C++ correctly (more like "C with classes," which is bad practice), but it motivated me to learn **Modern C++ (C++17)** later on.
- **No Dungeons Nor Dragons**: A small 2D RPG game in **C++** using **OpenGL 4** (GLFW + Glad). It was a simpler project than Voxel3D and my first attempt at using modern C++ concepts (like smart pointers, RAII, etc.).
- **Hnz-ECS**: I built a **game engine** in C++17 using an ECS (Entity Component System) architecture. This was mainly an educational project to learn how to create a game engine and implement an ECS from scratch. It was super interesting but far too ambitious to complete fully.
- **Encrypted Messaging**: A solo project where I built an **end-to-end encrypted messaging system** in C++17 using **OpenSSL**. I also designed a custom communication protocol. This was a research-oriented project, and I didn't plan for it to be easily usable by others.

I also worked on some fun **Modern C++** projects, like a Paint app, small games like Tetris and Snake, using **XMake** for project management.

## ü¶Ä Rust Projects

I started learning **Rust** in 2021 and built small projects to master the language (shout out to **Rust by Example**!). Eventually, I tackled more ambitious projects, such as:

- **L.I.F.E**: A mini **operating system** built in Rust by following Philipp Oppermann's tutorial. I learned a lot about OS architecture, built a bootloader and kernel, but the main goal was to explore Rust for more serious projects.
- [**ECS**](https://github.com/Hennzau/ecs): This project aimed to create an **ECS in Rust** with my best friend, using concepts from our Algorithmics course at CentraleSup√©lec. It was an exciting attempt to design an efficient algorithm for an ECS system.
- [**Raymarching2D**](https://github.com/Hennzau/2d-raymarching): A research project where I explored **raymarching** in 2D using **WGpu** and **WGSL**. I wanted to understand how raymarching works in rendering pipelines.
- [**Raymarching3D**](https://github.com/Hennzau/3d-raymarching): Similar to the 2D project, but this time in **3D**!
- [**ZZ**](https://github.com/Hennzau/zz): This is a comprehensive project to experiment with **GitHub development workflows**. It‚Äôs a set of tools for simplifying life with **Python**, mainly a wrapper around `uv` to make the beginner experience even easier. The entire release workflow is automated with `cargo-dist`.
- [**Dora**](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora): I started contributing to this **robotics framework** in Rust in 2023. I implemented `Dora` on real robots (a simulated car and 3 different pairs of robotic arms) during an internship at Hugging Face. We integrated the `LeRobot` library into `Dora` pipelines to conduct robotics experiments with **machine learning models**.
- [**Fastformat**](https://github.com/dora-rs/fastformat): A project I maintain for the `dora-rs` organization. It‚Äôs a **data formatting library** for sensor data into **Arrow** format. It complements `Dora` because `Dora` uses Arrow format for communication, making Fastformat useful for sharing real-world data in robotics programs. This was my first time working with **Test Driven Development (TDD)**, and I learned a lot about code quality and robust testing. üß™‚úÖ

That‚Äôs a wrap on the projects I‚Äôve worked on! Each project taught me something new, and I‚Äôm always eager to dive into the next one. üòä
